Nothing

6.12.041: (Not released yet).
Nothing

6.12.031: (Not released yet).
[CHANGED]Temperature of plasma set to 4000K
[CHANGED]For MultyBlock Heat Exchanger now need Thermomechanical Block.
[CHANGED]Fusion now accept energy LU to do process.And it dont output energy now.Some of its recipes now output plasma.
[CHANGED]Cryo Distillation Tower now use Frost Proof Machine Casing instead of Distillation Tower Part
[CHANGED]Engine recipe now use medium pipe.Iridium Engine now output 1024RU.Tungsten now output 512RU and its efficiency is a little more than tungstensteel Engine
[CHANGED]
Now MultiBlock Heat Exchanger has 3 texture to build.
TungstenSteel/Tungsten/Tantalum Hafnium Carbide.
They can output HU:16384/32768/131072.
[ADDED]Frost Proof Machine Casing for Cryo Distillation Tower build.
[ADDED]Thermomechanical block for Heat Exchanger
[ADDED]Reactors can use Distilled Water as Coolant, but that uses a different System so beware.Connect from Original GT6 Version
[ADDED]
Titanium Niobium Carbide.You can use it for crucible(And Large crucible)Large Boiler, tools pipe and tank.
Its pipe and tank can store plasma too.
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Engine Turbine.
Build like gas/steam turbine.It uses Engine fuels.Its a MultyBlock for Diesel Engine
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Plasma Turbine.
Build like gas/steam turbine.Uses plasma fuel!Plasma fuel has a very high turbine value.
And this is a new way that using fusion to make energy.
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Cracking Tower.
A little different for building.It need 3x3x10 Cracking Tower Part.
Cracking in Cracking Tower can get more products than single block cracking machine.

6.12.021:
[CHANGED]Now Large Autoclave can accept energy.It can do 32 process at the same time too.
[CHANGED]Now Engine output be more.But they are no longer have 100%EFFICIENCY.
[ADDED]Tungsten Engine
[ADDED]
Autoclave(LV-IV)That use energy to work. 

*NOTE:For Original GT6 Version changelogs.You can see in this https://gregtech.overminddl1.com/changelog
