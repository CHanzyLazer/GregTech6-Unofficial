Nothing

6.13.03: (Not released yet).
Nothing

6.13.02: (Not released yet).
[WIP]
MultyBlock Particle Collider.Build like fusion reactor.
Now you can build it but its purpose will be added in the future.
[WIP]
Subatomic particles and antimatter.

6.13.01:
[ADDED]General version for Autoclave.

6.13.00:
[FIXED]Gearboxes sometimes breaking/overloading on World Load.
[FIXED]A Rare NEI Recipe List Crash. (Concurrent Modification Exception when clicking Progress Bar)
[FIXED]Bedrock Ores did not generate Indicator Flowers and Indicator Rocks in Twilight Forest due to its Terrains normal Height of Y31 instead of Y63.
[FIXED]The Code that made Plates, Ingots and Rocks placeable did not check if the Stack was already a Block, meaning it just replaced things like Greatwood Planks or Silverwood Planks with the Stack-of-Plates Block.
[CHANGED]Temperature of plasma set to 4000K
[CHANGED]Implosion Compressor now accept EU to do process.
[CHANGED]The Matter Replicators are working 4 times than before.
[CHANGED]For MultyBlock Heat Exchanger now need Thermomechanical Block.
[CHANGED]Now Distillation Tower need 3x3x12 Distillation Tower Parts to build.
[CHANGED]Fusion now accept energy LU to do process.And it dont output energy now.Some of its recipes now output plasma.
[CHANGED]Cryo Distillation Tower now use Frost Proof Machine Casing instead of Distillation Tower Part
[CHANGED]Engine recipe now use medium pipe.Iridium Engine now output 1024RU.Tungsten now output 512RU and its efficiency is a little more than tungstensteel Engine
[CHANGED]
Now MultiBlock Heat Exchanger has 3 texture to build.
TungstenSteel/Tungsten/Tantalum Hafnium Carbide.
They can output HU:16384/32768/131072.
[CHANGED]
Now when you put molten metal to the tank the temperature will drop and you can no longer output it.
If the temperature drops below melting point you need to heat the tank in order to melt the metal.
[ADDED]Naphtha and gas oil for cracking product.
[ADDED]Frost Proof Machine Casing for Cryo Distillation Tower build.
[ADDED]Thermomechanical block for Heat Exchanger
[ADDED]Reactors can use Distilled Water as Coolant, but that uses a different System so beware.From Original GT6 Version
[ADDED]
Assembler for Circult processing!And it has some other assembly recipes by Greg.
[ADDED]
Titanium Niobium Carbide.You can use it for crucible(And Large crucible)Large Boiler, tools pipe and tank.
Its pipe and tank can store plasma too.
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Engine Turbine.
Build like gas/steam turbine.It uses Engine fuels.Its a MultyBlock for Diesel Engine
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Plasma Turbine.
Build like gas/steam turbine.Uses plasma fuel!Plasma fuel has a very high turbine value.
And this is a new way that using fusion to make energy.
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Oil Cleaner.
3x3x3 Hallow with Clean StainlessSteel Machine Casing.
For processing in MultyBlock can get all Products than mixer.
And now DistillationTower will output dirty oil (Oil with Sulfer) So you need put in machine to get clean oil.
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Cracking Tower.
Cracking in Cracking Tower can get more products than single block cracking machine.
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Molecular Scanner.
Now Molecular Scanner only has MultyBlock Version.It can overcheap clocking and accept a high voltage energy.
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Large Matter Replicator.
MultyBlock version for Matter Replicator.It has 64 Parallel. 
[ADDED]
MultyBlock Industry Coke Oven.
Do recipes as Coke Oven.Use energy to over clocking!

6.12.021:
[CHANGED]Now Large Autoclave can accept energy.It can do 32 process at the same time too.
[CHANGED]Now Engines output more, but they no longer have 100% Efficiency.
[ADDED]Tungsten Engine
[ADDED]Autoclaves (LV-IV) That use energy to work.
