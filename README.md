## Introduction

This mod is an [unofficial but approved](https://forum.mechaenetia.com/tag/approved) continuation of [GregTech-6](https://github.com/GregTech6/gregtech6). 

Note: GT6 official branch is still being developed, though it will be mostly bugfixes, but also PRs. (Gregorious is going to make his own Game Mechaenetia ^^) And I will be merging official branch commits into GT6U. For details, visit this [post](https://forum.mechaenetia.com/t/gregtech-6-main-thread/34/168). 

The development work of GT6U is undertaken by development team GT6U-Team, and its development direction is to continue to improve the technology line of GT6 and add more practical equipment.

* Added dozens of new fluids to make the organic chemical tech tree more complete

* Brand new chromite treatment!

* Brand new PVC, PTFE, epoxy resin, and their derivatives (pipes, storage tanks)!

* Added a variety of large machines, including large roasting ovens, industrial coke ovens, large dryers, cracking towers, particle colliders, mask aligners, large high-temperature mixers, etc.

* Added a variety of small machines, including circuit assembly machine, fluid curing machine, laser cutting machine, electric autoclave, high temperature mixer, etc.

* Some adjustments to the original electronic industry.

* Diversified gameplay, such as nuclear power reactors that can be cooled with distilled water.

## Upgrading from GT6 to GT6U

You can easily update your GT6 official world to GT6U by replacing the original GT6 jar file, but do NOTE that:

* Distillation Tower and Cryo Distillation Tower won't work with original design in GT6 official branch, but you can easily fix it by looking at the tooltips of the mainblocks.

* Fusion reactor now accepts LU as start energy while requires EU as maintain energy.

* Some recipes are changed so check NEI if you find out some of your machines not working.

If other bugs emerge when updating the world, submit a GitHub issue. (Just click the Issues button above)
