## Introduction

This mod is an [unofficial but approved](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fforum.mechaenetia.com%252ftag%252fapproved) continuation of [GregTech-6](https://github.com/GregTech6/gregtech6). 

Note: GT6 official branch is still being developed, though it will be mostly bugfixes, but also PRs. (Gregorious is going to make his own Game Mechaenetia ^^) And I will be merging official branch commits into GT6U. For details, visit this [post](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fforum.mechaenetia.com%252ft%252fgregtech-6-main-thread%252f34%252f168).
